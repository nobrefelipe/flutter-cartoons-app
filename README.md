# Flutter Favorite Cartoons App

Cartoons, vivid colors, animations and transitions. What's better than that? Flutter! In this experiment I implemented a concept from Dribbble designer Brio6.

This is a simple concept but full of nice opportunities to learn what Flutter has to offer.

The main focus here is the carousel, where we can swipe to the next character and animate the image.

Other than that, we have a nice transition between the carousel and the character detail page.

As Flutter web is still in beta, the app doesnt works very nice on the web. 
So I recorded the native working version, [you can try it here.](https://dribbble.com/shots/6403829-Movie-Character-UI-Animation)
